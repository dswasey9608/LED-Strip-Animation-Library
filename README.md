# NOTICE:
This project is currently being built from the FastLED library that is widely used in the Arduino software and IDE. Eventually it is my goal to create my own code all from scratch after learning about different types of LED interfaces and communication protocols.

# Car-LED-Controller
For use in in-car custom lighting with a (currently) WS2812B LED setup.


# Current To-Do list:
- [ ] Add photoresistor for auto-dimming
- [ ] Design and 3D print a custom car interface for any buttons/sensors
- [ ] Implement more mode cycling and/or buttons, for bigger variety
- [ ] Learn how to use IR remote.
## Completed:
  - [X] Add button functionality for on-demand mode cycling


# Featured modes:
* Scroll effect
* Stacking lights
* Color shifter with scrolling
* R to B to G linear gradient transition
